        <h2>About Us: The Green Schools Dagoretti Project</h2>
        <p>
          The Green Schools Dagoretti project is a local initiative with a
          global vision, born from the urgent need to address environmental
          challenges within Nairobi's urban context. Our work is rooted in the
          belief that sustainable change begins at the grassroots level,
          particularly in our schools. Dagoretti, with its diverse communities
          and socio-economic landscapes, including informal settlements,
          presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate how environmental
          education can directly improve lives and build a more resilient
          future. We are more than just a project; we are a community of
          students, teachers, parents, and partners committed to transforming
          our local environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to nurture eco-conscious leaders by embedding green
          practices into education, everyday school life, and community
          activities. We strive to empower the next generation with the
          knowledge, skills, and values needed to become effective stewards of
          our planet, shaping a future where people and nature grow together. We
          believe that by integrating sustainability into the curriculum and
          daily routines, we can create a lasting impact that extends far beyond
          the classroom.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a world where every school becomes a model of
          environmental stewardship. A world where students are empowered to be
          changemakers who actively contribute to a healthier planet. Through
          our work in Dagoretti, we aim to demonstrate how schools, especially
          those in resource-constrained areas, can become hubs for innovation
          and sustainability, inspiring communities to thrive through
          sustainable practices.
        </p>
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          The Green Schools Dagoretti project aims to create an eco-friendly
          learning environment by implementing practical, sustainable solutions.
          We work directly with schools in the area to establish key initiatives
          and provide hands-on experiences that empower students and the
          community. Our core activities include:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 1.5em">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <strong>Tree Planting and Reforestation:</strong> We organize
            regular tree planting drives within schools and the wider community.
            These drives are more than just planting trees; they are a hands-on
            lesson in combating deforestation, creating green spaces, and
            fostering a sense of ownership among students.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <strong>Environmental Education and Nature Tours:</strong> To deepen
            understanding and appreciation for the natural world, we lead
            environmental and nature educational tours. These excursions take
            students to local parks, nature reserves, and recycling centers,
            providing real-world context for classroom lessons on biodiversity,
            waste management, and conservation.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <strong>Waste Management and Recycling Programs:</strong> We educate
            students and staff on the importance of proper waste segregation and
            management, turning trash into a valuable resource and reducing
            landfill waste.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <strong>Solar Energy Initiatives:</strong> We work to introduce
            solar power solutions to schools, reducing energy costs and
            providing a reliable source of clean energy for lighting, computing,
            and other essential needs.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <strong>Water Conservation and Harvesting:</strong> We implement
            rainwater harvesting systems and promote water-saving techniques to
            ensure schools have a consistent and sustainable water supply,
            especially crucial in water-scarce areas.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By transforming schools into centers of sustainability, we are not
          only protecting the environment but also building a foundation for a
          healthier, more prosperous future for the children and families of
          Dagoretti.
